# GOAL OF Philosopher
For this project, we have (n > 1) philosopher and (philosopher + 1) forks. All philosopher have one fork on his left. We can imagine all the philosophe sit around a table, the philosophe can only think eat and sleep. When you lunch the program you need to add n_philosophe, time_die, time_eat, time_sleep.
```
./philo n_philo(1,200) time_die(n > 60) time_eat(n > 60) time_sleep(n > 60)
```
